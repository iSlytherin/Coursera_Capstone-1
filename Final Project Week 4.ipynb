    "This capstone project is made specifically for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, where a hypothetical scenario is raised. I chose Singapore for this project. Singapore,famously known as the \"the red dot\" on the world map, is one of the most important financial and transport hubs in Asia. Due to its geographical advantages, Singapore welcomes tourists from all around the world. Each year, Singapore attracts a lot of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, and advanced infrastructure. <br>\n",

    "Singapore has a decent amount of shoping malls, because Singporeans of all ages like to go to shopping malls for different purposes, some for shopping, some for dining out, some for watching movies... Not only the locals love going to shopping mall, but also the millions of tourists who visit Singapore each year. "
