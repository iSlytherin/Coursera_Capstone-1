# Coursera_Capstone
This is for IBM data science certificate capstone project only, which includes a few assignments and a final project.
The topic of the final project is to analyze a hypothetical scenario, which is to find the best location to open a shopping mall in Singapore, in which I used data science methodology, (data cleaning, data wrangling and data visualization) and a few machine learning techniques (including K-Means clustering) in solving the problem and reach a final recommendation.
